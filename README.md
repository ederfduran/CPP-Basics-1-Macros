# CPP-Basics-1-Macros

**Note:** **Open with VS2015**

The topics are: 
* Usage of preprocessor directives (#definde, #include ,include-guards)
* Macros-basics 
* Unit tests with macro assert
* Namespaces

# Good Practices
- Always use include guards in header files.
- Use Assert to catch critical issues in development phase.(The Macro assert only works in debug mode).
- use "using namespace" only in source files. (.cpp)
- Try to put all your code in a namespaces.
